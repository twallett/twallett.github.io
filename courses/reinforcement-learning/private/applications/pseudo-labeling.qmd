## A Framework for Pseudo-labeling with Deep Reinforcement Learning (Capstone Group 11)

[Self-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning) is a type of learning in machine learning (alongside supervised and unsupervised learning) where the task is to train a model (usually referred to as the *downstream model*) to generate supervisory signals for creating labels. Reinforcement learning can be used in this context to leverage sequential decision-making to improve the performance of the downstream model.

Suppose the dataset selected is [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

The state space $\mathcal{S}$ consists of the state vector $\mathbf{s}$, which is constructed as a flattened concatenation of:

$$
\mathbf{s} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{X} \gets \text{features at the current timestep} \\
\text{softmax}(\mathbf{y}) \gets \text{softmax labels predicted by the downstream model} \\
\mathcal{L} \gets \text{current loss value} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The action space $\mathcal{A}$ consists of the dataset labels and an additional option to skip labeling:

$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ 0, 1, \ldots, 9, \ \text{skip} \}
$$

The piecewise reward function $R$ is defined as:

$$
R = 
\begin{cases}
-1 & \text{if } a = \text{skip}, \\
\text{metric}_t - \text{metric}_{t-1} & \text{if } a \neq \text{skip}.
\end{cases}
$$

The environment dynamics $P(s', r \mid s, a)$ correspond to transitioning to the next feature in the dataset.

The episode ends when the agent has processed all samples in the dataset:

- **Termination**: once the complete length of the dataset has been reached.
